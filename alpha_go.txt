######## ALPHA GO ########

Description:

There are N stones in a bag, numbered from 1 to N. There are two prime numbers
(including 1) x and y in the bag such that:

All the stones numbered with a multiple of X are white in color;
All the stones numbered with a multiple of Y are black in color;
All the stones numbered with a multiple of (X*Y) are green in color;
Rest of the stones are yellow in color;

You play the game ALPHA_GO in which there are two teams such that:

Team 1 can have only black and yellow stones;
Team 2 can have only white and yellow stones;

To play the game team 1 and team 2 must have initially S1 and S2 number of stones respectively;

Write a program to return the minimum number of stones required to play the game.


Input:

input1: S1, the number of stones team1 should initially must have to play the game;
input2: S2, the number of stones team2 should initially must have to play the game; 
input3: X, first prime number;
input4: Y, second prime number;


Output:

output should be the minimum number of stones that is required to play the game. i.e N;


Case1: 
{

Input:
{

input1: 3;
input2: 1;
input3: 2;
input4: 3;

}

Output: 5;

Explanation:
{ 

White stones are numbered with a multiple of 2(i.e 1,2,4,6,8,...);
Black stones are numbered with a multiple of 3(i.e 1,3,6,9,...);
Green balls are numbered with a multiple of 2*3(=6)(i.e 1,6,12,18,...);
Yellow stones are numbered with rest of the numbers(i.e 5,7,11,13,..);

Team1 can have only black and yellow stones(i.e 1,3,5,6,7,9,11,13);
Team2 can have only white and yellow stones(i.e 1,2,4,5,7,8,...);

To get minimum distinct number from 1 to N, following combinations are made:
Team1 has 3(=S1) stones at start(i.e 1,3,5);
Team2 has 1(=S2) stones at the start(i.e 2 or 4);

The stone set will be {1,2,3,4,5}
Hence total stones required are 5(=N).

Input:
{

input1: 1;
input2: 3;
input3: 2;
input4: 3;

}

Output: 4;
